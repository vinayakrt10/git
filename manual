Git Basics 
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is widely used for tracking changes in 
source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has 
since become the de facto standard for version control in the software development industry.  
Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by providing a history of changes, 
facilitating the tracking of who made what changes and when. Here are some key concepts and 
features of Git:  
1. Repository (Repo): A Git repository is a directory or storage location where your project's 
files and version history are stored. There can be a local repository on your computer and 
remote repositories on servers.  
2. Commits: In Git, a commit is a snapshot of your project at a particular point in time.Each 
commit includes a unique identifier, a message describing the changes, and a reference to the 
previous commit.  
3. Branches: Branches in Git allow you to work on different features or parts of your project 
simultaneously without affecting the main development line (usually called the "master" 
branch). Branches make it easy to experiment, develop new features, and merge changes back 
into the main branch when they are ready.  
4. Pull Requests (PRs): In Git-based collaboration workflows, such as GitHub or GitLab, pull 
requests are a way for developers to propose changes and have them reviewed by their peers. 
This is a common practice for open-source and team-based projects.  
5. Merging: Merging involves combining changes from one branch (or multiple branches) into 
another. When a branch's changes are ready to be incorporated into the main branch, you can 
merge them.  
6. Remote Repositories: Remote repositories are copies of your project stored on a different 
server. Developers can collaborate by pushing their changes to a remote repository and pulling 
changes from it. Common remote repository hosting services include GitHub, GitLab, and 
Bitbucket.  
7. Cloning: Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your local 
machine. This allows you to work on the project and make changes locally.  
8. Forking: Forking is a way to create your copy of a repository, typically on a hosting platform 
like GitHub. You can make changes to your fork without affecting the original project and later 
create pull requests to contribute your changes back to the original repository. Git is known for 
its efficiency, flexibility, and ability to handle both small and large-scale software projects. It is 
used not only for software development but also for managing and tracking changes in various 
types of text-based files, including documentation and configuration files. Learning Git is 
essential for modern software development and  collaboration.  
Why we need git? 
Git is an essential tool in software development and for many other collaborative and version 
controlled tasks. Here are some key reasons why Git is crucial:  
1. Version Control: Git allows you to track changes in your project's files over time. It provides a 
complete history of all changes, making it easy to understand what was done, when it was 
done, and who made the changes. This is invaluable for debugging, auditing, and collaboration.  
2. Collaboration: Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project  
simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. It provides mechanisms for merging 
changes made by different contributors and resolving conflicts when they occur.  
3. Branching: Git supports branching, which allows developers to create isolated  
environments for developing new features or fixing bugs. This is essential for managing 
complex software projects and experimenting with new ideas without affecting the main 
codebase.  
4. Distributed Development: Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that every 
developer has a complete copy of the project's history on their local machine. This provides 
redundancy, facilitates offline work, and reduces the reliance on a central server.  
5. Backup and Recovery: With Git, your project's history is distributed across multiple locations, 
including local and remote repositories. This provides redundancy and makes it easy to recover 
from accidental data loss or system failures.  
6. Code Review: Git-based platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide tools for code 
review and collaboration. Developers can propose changes, comment on code, and discuss 
improvements, making it easier to maintain code quality.  
7. Open Source and Community Development: Git has become the standard for open 
source software development. It allows anyone to fork a project, make contributions, and 
create pull requests, which makes it easy for communities of developers to collaborate on a 
single codebase.  
8. Efficiency: Git is designed to be fast and efficient. It only stores the changes made to files, 
rather than entire file copies, which results in small repository sizes and faster operations.  
9. History and Documentation: Git's commit history and commit messages serve as a  
form of documentation. It's easier to understand the context and reasoning behind a change by 
looking at the commit history and associated messages. 
10. Customizability: Git is highly configurable and extensible. You can set up hooks and scripts 
to automate workflows, enforce coding standards, and integrate with various tools. 
Git Life Cycle  
The Git lifecycle refers to the typical sequence of actions and steps you take when using Git to 
manage your source code and collaborate with others. Here's an overview of the Git lifecycle:  
1. Initializing a Repository:  
To start using Git, you typically initialize a new repository (or repo) in your  
project directory. This is done with the command git init.  
2. Working Directory:  
Your project files exist in the working directory. These are the files you are  
actively working on.  
3. Staging:  
Before you commit changes, you need to stage them. Staging allows you to  
select which changes you want to include in the next commit. You use the git  
add command to stage changes selectively or all at once with git add ..  
4. Committing:  
After you've staged your changes, you commit them with a message explaining  
what you've done. Commits create snapshots of your project at that point in  
time. You use the git commit command to make commits, like git commit -m  
"Add new feature".  
5. Local Repository:  
Commits are stored in your local repository. Your project's version history is  preserved there.  
6. Branching:  
Git encourages branching for development. You can create branches to work on  
new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.  
Use the git branch and git checkout commands for branching.  
7. Merging:  
After you've completed work in a branch and want to integrate it into the main  
codebase, you perform a merge. Merging combines the changes from one branch into another. 
Use the git merge command.  
8. Remote Repository:  
For collaboration, you can work with remote repositories hosted on servers like  
GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These repositories serve as a central hub for  
sharing code.  
9. Pushing:  
To share your local commits with a remote repository, you push them using the  
git push command. This updates the remote repository with your changes.  
10. Pulling:  
To get changes made by others in the remote repository, you pull them to your  
local repository with the git pull command. This ensures that your local copy is  
up to date.  
11. Conflict Resolution:  
Conflicts can occur when multiple people make changes to the same part of a  
file. Git will inform you of conflicts, and you must resolve them by editing the  
affected files manually.  
12. Collaboration:  
Developers can collaborate by pushing, pulling, and making pull requests in a  
shared remote repository. Collaboration tools like pull requests are commonly  
used on platforms like GitHub and GitLab.  
13. Tagging and Releases:  
You can create tags to mark specific points in the project's history, such as  
version releases. Tags are useful for identifying significant milestones.  
14. Continuous Cycle:  
The Git lifecycle continues as you repeat these steps over time to manage the  
ongoing development and evolution of your project. This cycle supports  
collaborative and agile software development.  
The Git lifecycle allows for effective version control, collaboration, and the management of 
complex software projects. It provides a structured approach to tracking and sharing changes, 
enabling multiple developers to work together on a project with minimal conflicts and a clear 
history of changes. 
Git Installation  
To install Git on your computer, you can follow the steps for your specific operating system:  
1. Installing Git on Windows:  
a. Using Git for Windows (Git Bash):  
• Go to the official Git for Windows website: https://gitforwindows.org/  
• Download the latest version of Git for Windows.  
• Run the installer and follow the installation steps. You can choose the default settings for 
most options.  
b. Using GitHub Desktop (Optional): 
• If you prefer a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git, you can also install GitHub Desktop, 
which includes Git. Download it from https://desktop.github.com/ and follow the installation 
instructions.  
2. Installing Git from Source (Advanced):  
• If you prefer to compile Git from source, you can download the source code from the official 
Git website (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the compilation instructions provided 
there. This is usually only necessary for advanced users.  
After installation, you can open a terminal or command prompt and verify that Git is correctly 
installed by running the following command:  
$ git --version  
If Git is installed successfully, you will see the Git version displayed in the terminal. You can now 
start using Git for version control and collaborate on software development projects.  
How to Configure the Git?  
Configuring Git involves setting up your identity (your name and email), customizing Git 
options, and configuring your remote repositories. Git has three levels of configuration: system, 
global, and repository-specific. Here's how you can configure Git at each level:  
1. System Configuration:  
• System-level configuration affects all users on your computer. It is typically used for site
specific configurations and is stored in the /etc/gitconfig file. 
To set system-level configuration, you can use the git config command with the --system flag 
(usually requires administrator privileges). For example:  
$ git config --system user.name "Your Name"  
$ git config --system user.email "your.email@example.com" 
1. 
Global Configuration:  
• Global configuration is specific to your user account and applies to all Git repositories on your 
computer. This is where you usually set your name and email.  
To set global configuration, you can use the git config command with the --global flag. For 
example:  
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"  
$ git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"  
You can also view your global Git configuration by using:  
$ git config --global --list

Expt No 03: 
Write the commands to stash your changes, switch branches, and then apply the stashed changes. 
git stash is a command to save the changes or updates in a temporary storage stack data structure. We 
push changes into stack by push operation, whenever if you  want to  remove pushed changes from 
stack by pop operation. 
Situation, sometime you are working for problem to implement wishing messages in “greetings.c”. Say 
first time you have implemented “greetings.c”  to print “Hello World” message and you have 
committed. Again you may require opening same file “geetings.c” to implement “Welcome to git lab” 
and “Good Morning” messages. To update the same file “greetings.c’”  better you plan to create a new 
branch “feature”  switch to that branch to do updates to “greetings.c” without affecting to your old 
commits.

Expt No 04: 
Clone a remote Git repository to your local machine. 
Cloning means getting or downloading remote git repository from github.com server to your local 
machine. 
To create remote git repository at github.com server you must first create PAT (personnel access token). 
To create PAT follow these steps: 
1. login to github.com with your registered email-id and password 
2. click on profile account icon in your github home page and choose settings 
3. click on developer settings in left side settings window 
4. Choose personnel access token (classic) in generate new token dropdown window 
5. Give PAT name in the text box and make NO Expiration in dropdown window 
6. Check on check box Repo, workflow, write packages and delete packages 
7. Finally click on generate new token button. 
The above steps gives you PAT key , copy the key and save it in a text file under your own directory. 
To create repository follow these steps: 
1. Go to your home page in github.com 
2. Click on create repository button 
3. Give  repository name in the text box  ( say : team_project) 
 
The url link ( url is uniform resource locator) of remote git repository is shown below: 
 
https://github.com/your username/team_project.git                           github.com server 
 
 you have  created an empty remote git repository                                                                  
 
                                                                                                                                                  Memory(Disk)   
This remote git repository is identified by default name : origin 
and default branch name for origin(team_project) is main                                                                                                                                                         
Cloning remote git repository to your local machine: 
1. Go to your own directory :     cd  “your directory”      (eg: cd naveen)                                                        
origin team_project.git                 
2. Clone git repository:     git clone “url link of remote git repository” 
(eg:  git clone https://github.com/navinaveen-b/team_project.git) 
When we clone this,  git says you have cloned an empty remote git repository 
3. List the content of your own directory:      ls 
 
You will see team_project  folder under your own directory 
 
               Updating remote git repository directly in your local machine 
1. Go to cloned team_project folder:      cd team_project 
2. You are working in remote git repository in your local machine. So, your branch name:    
“main” 
Update remote git repository branch main by creating one file and committing it. 
3. Create one file named new.txt:    notepad  new.txt  (edit it, save it and close notepad) 
4. Add to staging area:     git add . or git add new.txt 
5. Commit changes:       git commit -m “new.txt added” 
 
(Local machine)                                                                              Remote machine (github.com) 
 
                                                                                          (origin) 
 
                                                                        (clone) 
                                         
  
                                                                                                    (update) 
                               (HEAD            main) “new.txt added” 
6. Connect remote git repository to git:       
                    git remote add origin “url link of remote git repository” 
(eg:  git remote add origin https://github.com/navinaveen-b/team_projet.git) 
The above command   Error remote origin already exists, because you are working in 
team_project.git  (igmore the Error) 
7. Update the remote git repository:                                                  Updated remote git repository            
  git push -u origin main                                             (origin)                                                                       
 
                                                                                          
                                                                                    (HEAD           main)  “new.txt added”

Expt No 05: 
Fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch onto the updated 
remote branch. 
Rebasing means applying all your local repository commits on top of the remote repository branch by 
doing this we creating new base level of our branch. 
First: Assume you have  updated remote git repository team_project.git  accordingly as from  Expt No 
04.                  
                                                                                          The updated remote git repository as ahown below  
 
                                                                                                           Updated remote git repository 
                                                                                               (origin) 
 
   
                                                                                                      (HEAD               main) “new.txt added” 
 
 
Second: you start working in your local git repository and make some commits by adding some files. 
Say, hello.c and welcome.c 
1. Go to your own directory: cd “your directory” 
(eg: cd naveen) 
2. mkdir  myproj5 
3. cd myproj5 
4. git init 
5. notepad hello.c    (edit it, save it and close notepad) 
6. git add . or git add hello.c 
7. git commit -m “hello.c added” 
8. notepad welcome.c    (edit it, save it and close notepad) 
9. git add . or git add welcome.c 
10. git commit  -m “welcome.c added” 
Your local git repository as shown below: 
 
team_project.git 
 
 
 
 
              (local git repository) 
 
 
(HEAD            master)  “welcome.c added” 
 
                                                   “hello.c added” 
 
Fetch the remote git repository under your local repository 
First connect remote git repository to the git 
 git  remote add origin “url link of remote git repository” 
(eg: git remote add origin https://github.com/navinaveen-b/team_project.git) 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                     ( connect) 
 
Fetch the remote branch:   git fetch origin       (it shows you fetched main identified as origin/main) 
 
 
Now your local repository have two branches  “master”  and  “origin/main”  is as shown below: 
myproj5 
.git 
myproj5 
.git  
team_project.git 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                        (HEAD            main)   “new.txt added “   
                                                                                             ( fetch)    
(HEAD            master)   “welcome.c added”                                
                                                (HEAD        orgin/main)   “new.txt added”  
      “hello.c added” 
 
Rebase your local repository commits on to remote branch 
git rebase orgin/main  
check the commit history log : git log --all 
After rebasing your branch tree  is as shown below: 
 
 
(HEAD-master)          “welcome.c added” 
                                          “hello.c added) 
(HEAD origin/main)    “new.txt added”  
 
Update the changes to remote git repository:                      (update) 
Change your branch “master” to “main”:                                           (HEADmain)          “welcome.c added” 
  git  branch –M main                                                                                                                        “hello.c added” 
Push the updates: push -u origin main                                                                                     “new.txt added”

Write the command to merge "feature-branch" into "master" while providing a custom commit 
message for the merge. 
Whenever you solving new problems in a new branch (feature-branch),  
you may solved printing of  
1. hello message by creating “hello.c”  and committed  with “feature-branch updated” 
2. welcome message by creating “welcome.c” and committed with “feature-branch updated” 
When you merge this “feature-branch” into “master” branch, to make identified in “master” while 
merging “feature-branch” we want to merge “feature-branch” with custom commit message. 
First, start working in “master” 
1. Go to your own directory:    cd “your own directory”    (eg: cd naveen) 
2. mkdir  myproj6 
3. cd myproj6 
4. git init 
5. notepad new.txt    (edit it, save it and close notepad) 
6. git add . or git add new.txt 
7. git commit -m “new.txt added” 
second, start working in feature-branch 
1. create new branch “feature-branch”:     git branch feature-branch 
2. Switch to “feature-branch” :                     
git checkout feature-branch 
3. notepad  hello.c              
(edit it , save it and close notepad) 
4. git add . or git add hello.c 
5. notepad welcome.c         
(edit it, save it and close notepad) 
6. git add . or git add welcome.c 
7. git commit -m “feature-branch: updated” 
Third, Merge “feature-branch” into “master”  with custom commit message 
1. Switch to master:      git checkout master 
2. Add changes to staging area:      git add . 
3. Commit the changes in “master”  by merging “feature-branch” with custom commit message: 
git merge –no-ff  feature-branch -m “feature-branch updated adding hello.c and welcome.c”  
4. Check commit history log:     git log --all   (see output) 
Expt No 07: 
Write the command to create a lightweight Git tag named "v1.0" for a commit in your local 
repository. 
Assume you may be implemented some programs for your project. Say, hello.c and welcome.c and 
committed. Assume you have implemented “welcome.c” by using older compiler version 1.0 using print 
function like this:     print(“Welcome to Git Lab”); so, welcome.c can be compiled using compiler version 
1.0. SO, you to give a tag for the welcome.c commit as :  V1.0. 
1. Go to your own directory:    cd “your own directory”      (eg: cd naveen) 
2. Create project folder:            mkdir myproj7 
3. Move to project folder:         cd myproj7 
4. Initialize git directory:           git init 
5. Create “hello.c” file:               notepad hello.c 
                                                                                 int main() 
                                                                                 { 
                                                                                          printf(“Hello World\n”);

Expt No 08: 
Write the command to cherry-pick a range of commits from "source-branch" to the current branch. 
git cherry-pick <start-commit>^..<end-commit> 
git cherry-pick command picks range of commits from start commit-id  to end commit-id from one 
branch to another branch. 
<start-commit> is starting commit-id and <end-commit> is ending commit-id. 
Assume, your source branch is "master" and current branch is "feature" 
First start working in master 
1. Go to your own directory:      cd “your directory”      (eg: cd naveen) 
2. Create project folder:              
mkdir myproj8 
3. Move to project folder:           
4. Initialize git directory:              
cd myproj8 
git init 
5. Create a file named new.txt:     notepad new.txt    (edit it, save it and close notepad) 
6. Add to staging area:                
git add .    or git add new.txt 
7. Commit the changes:              
git commit -m “new.txt added” 
8. Check commit history log in “master”:       
output shows as shown below: 
34d79df (HEAD -> master) new.txt added 
git log --oneline    (see output) 
Second create branch “feature”  and start working there 
1. Create “feature” branch:        
git branch feature 
2. Switch to “feature” branch:    git checkout feature 
3. Create file named mytext1.txt:      
notepad mytext1.txt    (edit it , save it and close notepad) 
4. Add it to staging area:               
5. Commit the changes:                 
git add . or git add mytext1.txt 
git commit -m “mytext1.txt added” 
Repeat 3,4 and 5 to create files mytext2.txt,mytext3.txt,mytext4.txt and mytext5.txt and 
commit. 
6. Check commit history log in “feature”:      git log --oneline 
Output shows as shown below: 
9adbe88 (HEAD -> feature) mytext5.txt added 
78e3fbe mytext4.txt added 
23dbc7a mytext3.txt added                                            
(These 5 commits is from “feature”)     
dbce617 mytext2.txt added 
 6647dda mytext1.txt added 
 34d79df (master) new.txt added     (This commit is from “master”) 
 
 
Third switch to “master” and start working there 
 
1. Switch to “master”:        git checkout master 
2. To cherry-pick range of commits  as shown above in red color from “feature” to “master” 
branch: 
                                           git  cherry-pick dbce617^..78e3fbe 
3. Check now commit history log in “master”:            git log --oneline  
 
output shows as shown below: 
 
7273594(HEAD -> master) mytext4.txt added 
3e1717e mytext3.txt added 
8256ff7 mytext2.txt added 
34d79df new.txt added 
 
Expt No 09: 
Given a commit ID, how would you use Git to view the details of that specific commit, including the 
author, date, and commit message? 
When user committed any changes in the git repository , git records or stores details like 
Author : which user as committed . that is user configured to the git  
                 (eg: git config --global  user.name “navinaveen-b” 
Date: when was committed  
Commit Message: what commit message is given 
 
By knowing commit-id we can view the above details. All commit-id can be viewed by the commad 
   git log –oneline 
1. Go to your own directory:    cd “your directory”     (eg: cd naveen) 
2. Create project folder:            mkdir myproj9 
3. Move to project folder:         cd myproj9 
4. Initialize git repository:            git init 
5. Cerate file “hello.c”:              notepad hello.c      (edit it , save it and close notepad) 
6. Add it to staging area:           git add .    or git add hello.c 
7. Commit the changes:             git commit -m  “hello.c added” 
8. Create file “welcome.c”:        notepad welcome.c      (edit it, save it and close notepad) 
9. Add it to staging area:            git add .  or git add welcome.c 
10. Commit the changes:             git commit -m  “welcome.c added” 
11. Check the commit history log:      git log --oneline 
 
Output shows as shown below: 
a7eab84 (HEAD -> master) welcome.c added 
db8900c hello.c added 
12. To see the details of commit-id db8900c:      git show db8900c

Expt No 12: 
Write the command to undo the changes introduced by the commit with the ID "abc123". 
Sometimes we do implement solutions to several problems in a same implementation file, but solution 
implemented and committed contain bug/error. We can revert that commit by removing update 
changes by using   git revert “commit-id” . git revert command removes wrong updates made by 
commit-id and creates a new commit-id to come back to correct old commit. 
Assume you have two problems to print  “Hello World” and “Welcome to Git Lab” messages. First you 
implemented “Hello World” msg and committed  in a file “hello.c”  by using statement  printf(“Hello 
World\n”);. Second time you have implemented “Welcome to Git Lab” msg and committed in the same 
file “hello.c” by using statement   print(“Welcome to Git Lab\n”);. The second update changes and 
commit contains a bug/error (shown in red color). So we can revert this commit by removing wrong 
updates and create a new commit to the proper old commit state. 
1. Go to your directory:     cd “your own directory”     (eg: cd naveen) 
2. Create a project folder:     mkdir myproj12 
3. Move to project folder:     cd myproj12 
4. Initialize git repository:      git init 
5. Create a file “hello.c”:        notepad hello.c 
                                                           #include<stdio.h> 
                                                           int main() 
                                                            { 
                                                                   printf(“Hello World\n”); 
                                                                   return 0; 
                                                             }                (save it and close notepad) 
6. Add it to staging area:            git add .    or   git add hello.c 
7. Commit the changes:              git commit -m “hello.c:   “hello msg impl” 
8. Open same file “hello.c” and update:        notepad hello.c 
                                                                          #include<stdio.h> 
                                                                          int main() 
                                                                         { 
                                                                                printf(“Hello World\n”); 
                                                                                print(“Welcome to Git Lab\n”); 
                                                                                return 0; 
                                                                          }                (save it and close notepad) 
                                 (updates shown in red color) 
9. Add it to staging area:                   git add .     or   git add hello.c 
10. Commit the updated changes:        git commit -m “hello.c: Welcome msg impl” 
11. Check the commit history log:          git log --oneline  
Output shows as shown below: 
3631796 (HEAD -> master) hello.c Welcome msg impl 
0232b4f hello.c Hello msg impl 
   
The commit-id shown in bold contain error/bug , So we want to remove the update changes and 
revert back to old commit for proper state. 
12. To revert the commit “3631796”:      git revert 3631796 
 
This command opens “hello.c” file in notepad and asks for enter revert commit message. Just do 
save the file and close notepad 
13. Check finally commit history log:       git log --oneline  
 
Output shows as shown below: 
8506b19 (HEAD -> master) Revert "hello.c Welcome msg impl" 
3631796 hello.c Welcome msg impl 
0232b4f hello.c Hello msg impl 
 
(New coomit-id  “8506b19” in green color proper commit state removing updates of “3631796”) 
 
14. Check by opening “hello.c” file:          notepad hello.c 
                                                       (you can see the line print(“Welcome to Git Lab\n”)   is removed)
